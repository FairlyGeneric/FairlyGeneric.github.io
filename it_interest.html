							<h1 class="major">Interest in IT</h1>
							<p>Iâ€™ve had an interest towards IT for quite some time now. I remember my first experience with a computer back when I was about 12 years old. It was an old one, even for that time. It ran on Windows 98. That was a start to a longstanding interest in computers, from familiarising myself with which cords went where to writing code in java, my childhood fascination of computers evolved into a passion towards IT as a whole.</p>
							<p>The main reason for choosing to come to RMIT to study IT is because of its excellent reputation within the IT industry, which would likely present promising career opportunities and the like. On top of that, attending the various open days gave me a good insight into the student life of RMIT, and the facilities I would have at my disposal. The impression I received was positive, and thus I settled to enrol here.</p>
							<p>During my studies, I expect to gain a broad, flexible and useful insight into the IT industry as a whole. The courses I am currently taking cover a range of different aspects of IT, including programming, database concepts, user centred design and so on. Aside from just the courses however, I also aspire to develop social and networking skills from the various IT focused clubs RMIT has to offer.</p>
