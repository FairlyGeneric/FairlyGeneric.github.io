							<h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
							<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Link to test</a>
							<p></p>
							<p><b>Result:</b> INFP</p>
							<p>This reflects me as I am often a more reserved and quiet person, unless around peers that I am more comfortable with. I prefer a smaller, tight knit group of friends over a large, but less involved circle of friends. I have a set of personal values that I generally adhere to when making judgements, and I try to see the intent behind things. I’m likely to be more open minded in groups. This suggests that I work best in a small group of colleagues, as I can come to be more familiar with each of them, and be open to various different options for potential issues in the future. </p>

							<h2>Learning Styles Test</h2>
							<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Link to test</a>
							<p></p>
							<b>Results:</b>
							<ul>
												<li>Auditory: 25%</li>
												<li>Visual: 50%</li>
												<li>Tactile: 25%</li>
											</ul>
							<p>This suggests that I am a visual learner. In a team, this means I would work best drawing up diagrams and various other visual aids to both understand concepts and communicate them more effectively. It’s best to form a team with people that have a similar learning style, but also to include people with different learning styles as the test would suggest that Auditory and tactile leaning styles make up the remaining 50%.</p>

							<h2>Creative Problem Solving Test</h2>
							<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/tests/career/creative-problem-solving-test">Link to test</a>
							<p></p>
							<p><b>Result:</b> Openness to creativity - 88</p>
							<p>A result of 88 indicated that I have a high tendency to approach problems with a degree of creativity. In a team, I am more likely to be open to a variety of different solutions from different people, and seek to find different ways to approach things. It’s best for me to form a team of people who are all very different to each other, in order to produce aforementioned variety into the problem solving process.</p>
